        <p class="lead mb-4">Aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for all things computer science.<br><br>

        Yuchen Zhu is currently a fourth-year computer science major at the University of California, Riverside. His skills include programming languages C++, Java, SQL and Python, Amazon Web Services, Angular, XCode and Swift, embedded systems, and machine learning. His soft skills are writing, team building, and being a fast learner. <br><br>
        
        He is an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for the Computer Science Engineering Department at UCR. Through his experience as a previous tutor at a high school, he has used what he has learned to tutor his peers about the fundamental basics of computer science. He enjoys being able to help students who are struggling with concepts that he once had difficulty understanding when he first started out computer science. Through this position, he reviews and teaches data structures and algorithms vital to having a job in the field. <br><br>

        In the past year he has been involved in Rose Hack, UCR's women-centric hackathon as a sponsorship lead, making sure that the event ran flawlessly by gathering sponsors who also supported the hackathon's mission statement of creating a safe space for minorities in tech. He ended up raising over $10,000 by contacting and partnering with companies while also making new valuble connections with people who want to change the equality desparity within computer science. <br><br>
        
        A highlight of his past work experience is being a Software Developer Intern for the company retailMetrix, where he confirmed his passion for software engineering. In this position, he collaborated with a team of developers in fixing bugs, implementing new features, and contributing to both front-end and back-end development. Most impressively, he was named the Star Intern for exceptional contributions to the design and development of an Angular-based web app. <br><br>
        
        Some of his proud projects include an autonomous sentry system and a autonomous trash can. The autonomous sentry system made use of artificial intelligence for facial recognition as well as cloud computing by using Google Cloud and Nvidia Jetson Nanos. The idea and motive for using AI originated from his previous experience as a research assistant at the Brain Game Center at UCR where he assisted a graduate student in their research project in creating an AI  to recognize facial expressions. The project integrated an Arduino UNO R3 to control a nerf gun for precise engagement with detected targets. The autonomous trash can was another hardware project that also made use of an Arduino UNO R3 with IR communication and L298 motor control. <br><br>
        
        Ultimately, Yuchen's career goals are to become a software engineer for a company that has values that align with his own. He wishes to gain more experience and practice what he has learned through his college education and personal projects.
